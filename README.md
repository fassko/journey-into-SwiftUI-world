# A journey into the SwiftUI world - Tech Stash by Mintos

This session will be dedicated to SwiftUI, a framework for declarative UI structure design across all Apple platforms.
Since its first introduction at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in 2019, the framework and Swift language have both been significantly updated. SwiftUI is an opinionated framework, with quite strict guidelines, and as with every technology, we need to talk about its possible tradeoffs.
In this session, we will look into some of the challenges with SwiftUI, and how to overcome them with practical examples.
